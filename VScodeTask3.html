    <!--popular extentions-->
    <h1><u>Extentions of VS Code</u></h1>
    <p>Extensions in VS Code are add-ons that enhance its functionality by supporting additional languages, frameworks, tools, and features. They provide language support with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense, enable code formatting (like Prettier), integrate version control tools such as Git, allow real-time live previews (e.g., Live Server), and offer customization options like themes and icons. Extensions make VS Code more powerful and tailored to meet specific development needs, improving efficiency and user experience.</p>
